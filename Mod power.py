# So far, we have only heard of Python's powers. Now, we will witness them!
# 
# Powers or exponents in Python can be calculated using the built-in power function. Call the power function  as shown below:
# Task
# You are given three integers: a, b, and m. Print two lines.
# On the first line, print the result of pow(a,b). On the second line, print the result of pow(a,b,m)

# In[ ]:


a = int(input())
b = int(input())
m = int(input())
print (pow(a,b))
print (pow(a,b,m))


# In[ ]:
